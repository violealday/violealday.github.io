UMD bundle is 567B minified+gzipped\n\nMerge the enumerable attributes of two objects deeply.\n\n[***Check out the changes from version 1.x to 2.0.0***](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/deepmerge/blob/master/changelog.md#200)\n\nFor the old array element-merging algorithm, see [the `arrayMerge` option below](#arraymerge).\n\n## Webpack bug\n\nIf you have `require('deepmerge')` (as opposed to `import merge from 'deepmerge'`) anywhere in your codebase, Webpack 3 and 4 have a bug that [breaks bundling](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/6584).\n\nIf you see `Error: merge is not a function`, add this alias to your Webpack config:\n\n```\nalias: {\n\tdeepmerge$: path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/deepmerge/dist/umd.js'),\n}\n```\n\nexample\n=======\n\n<!--js\nvar merge = require('./')\n-->\n\n```js\nvar x = {\n\tfoo: { bar: 3 },\n\tarray: [{\n\t\tdoes:

new merged object with the\nelements from both `x` and `y`.\n\nIf an element at the same key is present for both `x` and `y`, the value from\n`y` will appear in the result.\n\nMerging creates a new object, so that neither `x` or `y` are be modified.\n\nmerge.all(arrayOfObjects, [options])\n-----------\n\nMerges any number of objects into a single result object.\n\n```js\nvar x = { foo: { bar: 3 } }\nvar y = { foo: { baz: 4 } }\nvar z = { bar: 'yay!' }\n\nvar expected = { foo: { bar: 3, baz: 4 }, bar: 'yay!' }\n\nmerge.all([x, y, z]) // => expected\n```\n\n### options\n\n#### arrayMerge\n\nThe merge will also concatenate arrays and merge array values by default.\n\nHowever, there are nigh-infinite valid ways to merge arrays, and you may want to supply your own.  You can do this by passing an `arrayMerge` function as an option.\n\nThe options object will include the default `isMergeableObject` implementation if the top-level consumer didn't pass a custom function in.\n\n```js\nfunction overwriteMerge(destinationArray, sourceArray, options) {\n\treturn sourceArray\n}\nmerge(\n\t[1, 2, 3],\n\t[3, 2, 1],\n\t{ arrayMerge: overwriteMerge }\n) // => [3, 2, 1]\n```\n\nTo prevent arrays from being merged:\n\n```js\nconst dontMerge = (destination, source) => source\nconst output = merge({ coolThing: [1,2,3] }, { coolThing: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }, { arrayMerge: dontMerge })\noutput // => { coolThing: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }\n```\n\nTo use the old (pre-version-2.0.0) array merging algorithm, pass in this function:\n\n```js\nconst emptyTarget = value => Array.isArray(value) ? [] : {}\nconst clone = (value, options) => merge(emptyTarget(value), value, options)\n\nfunction oldArrayMerge(target, source, options) {\n\tconst destination = target.slice()\n\n\tsource.forEach(function(e, i) {\n\t\tif (typeof destination[i] === 'undefined') {\n\t\t\tconst cloneRequested = options.clone !== false\n\t\t\tconst shouldClone = cloneRequested && options.isMergeableObject(e)\n\t\t\tdestination[i] = shouldClone ? clone(e, options) : e\n\t\t} else if (options.isMergeableObject(e)) {\n\t\t\tdestination[i] = merge(target[i], e, options)\n\t\t} else if (target.indexOf(e) === -1) {\n\t\t\tdestination.push(e)\n\t\t}\n\t})\n\treturn destination\n}\n\nmerge(\n\t[{ a: true }],\n\t[{ b: true }, 'ah yup'],\n\t{ arrayMerge: oldArrayMerge }\n) // => [{ a: true, b: true }, 'ah yup']\n```\n\n#### isMergeableObject\n\nBy default, deepmerge clones every property from almost every kind of object.\n\nYou may not want this, if your objects are of special types, and you want to copy the whole object instead of just copying its properties.\n\nYou can accomplish this by passing in a function for the `isMergeableObject` option.\n\nIf you only want to clone properties of plain objects, and ignore all \"special\" kinds of instantiated objects, you probably want to drop in [`is-plain-object`](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/is-plain-object).\n\n```js\nconst isPlainObject = require('is-plain-object')\n\nfunction SuperSpecial() {\n\tthis.special = 'oh yeah man totally'\n}\n\nconst instantiatedSpecialObject = new SuperSpecial()\n\nconst target = {\n\tsomeProperty: {\n\t\tcool: 'oh for sure'\n\t}\n}\n\nconst source = {\n\tsomeProperty: instantiatedSpecialObject\n}\n\nconst defaultOutput = merge(target, source)\n\ndefaultOutput.someProperty.cool // => 'oh for sure'\ndefaultOutput.someProperty.special // => 'oh yeah man totally'\ndefaultOutput.someProperty instanceof SuperSpecial // => false\n\nconst customMergeOutput = merge(target, source, {\n\tisMergeableObject: isPlainObject\n})\n\ncustomMergeOutput.someProperty.cool // => undefined\ncustomMergeOutput.someProperty.special // => 'oh yeah man totally'\ncustomMergeOutput.someProperty instanceof SuperSpecial // => true\n```\n\n#### clone\n\n*Deprecated.*\n\nDefaults to `true`.\n\nIf `clone` is `false` then child objects will be copied directly instead of being cloned.
